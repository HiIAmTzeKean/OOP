# Encapsulation

Wrapping [[Object]] private data and public method into one entity. Users will only know what the **methods** of the [[Class]] but does not know the **implementation** details.

## Getters and Setters

Other objects cannot directly manipulate the attributes. Accessor and mutator allows controlled access to an object's data, thereby supporting [[Data hiding]].

## Interfaces

Interface supports [[Encapsulation]] with proper [[Access designation]] to make attribute private and [[Method]] public to access the data.
