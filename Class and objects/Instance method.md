# Instance method

Any [[Method]] that is not static is called instance method.

## Uses
Method belong to the object of the class and not the class. The methods can only be called after creation of the [[Object]]. 

## Access
- Instance methods can access both [[Static method]] and [[Static variable]] directly.
- Overriding of these methods are possible since they are only resolved using [[Dynamic linking]]
