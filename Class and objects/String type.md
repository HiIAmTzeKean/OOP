# String type

In Java, strings are created as [[Object]]. *java.lang.String* is the class that represents the strings.

## Properties
Since Strings are objects, **new** keyword must be used to indicate new [[Object]] creation.

Strings are **immutable**, creation of "java program" is final, and cannot be changed. If we need another string, we have to create another string object. #EXAM
```java
String var = "some string";
// another string object is created here
// Strings are immutable
var = "new string";
```
