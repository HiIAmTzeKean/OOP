# Static keyword

Use in declaration of variable or [[Method]].

[[Static variable]]  and [[Static method]] is applied to the whole class instead of individual [[Object]].

A **common** separate memory allocated to store value for [[Static variable]] and method, and only a **single copy** of static variable is allocated for all [[Object]] such that all objects from the [[Class]] share the same variable.

## Usage with [[FInal keyword]]
- Better code readability
