# Aggregation and composition

"Whole-part" relationship

## Aggregation

- The parts can exist without the whole
- The parts are thus aggregated (formed into a cluster) into the whole

## Composition

- The parts cannot exist without the whole
- The whole must first be created before the parts are created -> whole instantiates the parts
