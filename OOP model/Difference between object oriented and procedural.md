# Difference between object oriented and procedural

In [[Object oriented programming|OOP]], the attributes and behaviours are encapsulated in a single object. In [[Procedural programming]], the attributes and behaviours are normally separated.

## Data behaviour in procedural programming

1. The data is global and any function can modify the data outside the scope of the code -> no control over data modification
2. Testing and debugging is tougher since it is difficult to check how the data was modified

## Advantage of OOP

1. When well designed, there will be no global data -> high [[Data integrity]] in system.
