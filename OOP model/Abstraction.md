# Abstraction

Design [[Object]] with **essential characteristics** such as attributes and [[Method]] with the **perspective** of how the object can perform.

## Example

Given different types of mobile phones, we can abstract the attributes by giving it general names such as *colour* and *ringTone*. We can also abstract behaviours such as *ring*, *answer* and *call*.
