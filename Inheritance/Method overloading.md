# Method overloading

>[!important]
>This is not a behaviour due to inheritance.

[[Method overloading]] happens **within the same class** where method performs differently depending on the signature provided
- [[Method]] defined with different **number** of parameters
- [[Method]] defined with different parameter **type**

## Advantage
- Methods perform similar task, but differ only in number or type of parameter
    - We avoid coming up with different method names to perform similar tasks
    - Single method that accepts different signatures
