# Inheritance

>[!Important]
>Is-a relationship

Enables a class to inherit attributes and [[Method]] from another [[Class]], allowing [[Abstraction]] of common attributes and behaviour from another class. Uses **Is-a relation**.

## Class inheritance
### Parent class
[[Superclass]] or the [[Base class]] is the class which another class will inherit the structure from. They are **generalisation** of subclass.

The root of all [[Class]] belongs to *java.lang.Object*

### Child class
[[Subclass]] or [[Derived class]] is the class inheriting. They are **Specialisations** of superclass.

## Benefits
- Creation of new class without extensive duplication of code
- Can reuse parent code.
