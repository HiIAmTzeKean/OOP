# Multiple inheritance

[[Inheritance]] but from more than one [[Superclass]]

## Issues

- Selection of method and attribute when both are present in more than 1 superclass
    - Either have user specified precedence -> [[Smalltalk]]
    - Renaming a method and inheriting both [[Method]]
    - Accept both [[Method]] if they have different signatures
